# OCRB v0 Disclosure

This report was generated by the OCRB reference runner.

## Compliance Declarations
- Stress parameters were declared prior to execution and treated as immutable.
- All stochastic behavior is seeded and disclosed via manifest seeds.
- Metrics are computed observationally from events and declared evidence.
- No adaptive behavior was used to alter execution in response to stress or proxy values.

## Notes
- Workload execution is currently stubbed in this runner.
- Replace stub workload generation with real W1/W2/W3 workload implementations before publishing results as OCRB runs.
