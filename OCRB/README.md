# OCRB Reference Implementation

This directory will contain the reference implementation of the
Orbital Compute Readiness Benchmark (OCRB).

The reference implementation exists to:
- Demonstrate a compliant realization of the OCRB v0 specification
- Serve as an executable clarification of normative documents
- Provide a reproducibility baseline for independent implementations

## Scope
- Implements OCRB v0 as specified
- Prioritizes correctness, transparency, and reproducibility
- Does not optimize for performance or deployment

## Non-Goals
- This is not production software
- This is not an SDK or platform
- This is not an optimized or adaptive system

All implementations must defer to the normative specifications.
