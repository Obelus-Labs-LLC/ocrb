# Orbital Compute Readiness Benchmark (OCRB) v0

## Complete Specification

**Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Technical Specification  
**Related Document:** OCRB_v0_Technical_Brief.md  

---

## 1. Scope of This Specification

This document defines the **normative measurement methodology** for OCRB v0.

It specifies:

- Formal definitions of all Behavioral Proxies
- Measurement procedures and normalization rules
- Orbital Reliability Index (ORI) construction
- Statistical requirements for reproducibility
- Explicit interpretation constraints

This document is **authoritative** for OCRB v0.  
Any implementation claiming OCRB v0 compliance **MUST** conform to this specification.

While OCRB is orbital-first in motivation, all definitions in this specification are **environment-agnostic** and apply to any constrained computational environment where foundational operating assumptions are violated.

---

## 2. Definitions and Notation

Let:

- **W** = declared workload under test  
- **S** = declared stress regime (SR-1 … SR-5 parameters)  
- **Rᵢ** = independent test run *i*  
- **BPⱼ** = Behavioral Proxy *j*, normalized to **[0,1]**  
- **ORI ∈ [0,1]**

All Behavioral Proxies **MUST** be defined such that their values lie within **[0,1]**.

All metrics are computed **per workload** and **per stress regime**.  
Results are invalid if workload or stress regime definitions differ.

---

## 3. Stress Regime Application Rules

### 3.1 Determinism and Reproducibility

- Stress regime parameters **MUST** be fully declared prior to execution
- Randomized stressors **MUST** use seeded pseudorandom generators
- Each independent run **MUST** use an independently seeded stress realization
- All seeds **MUST** be logged to enable replay and audit

### 3.2 Temporal Alignment

Stress injection **MUST** be temporally aligned with workload execution and applied consistently across all runs.

Stress regimes **MAY** be static or time-varying, but the temporal structure **MUST** be declared explicitly and held constant across comparative runs.

---

## 4. Behavioral Proxy Specifications

### 4.1 BP-1: Graceful Degradation Score (GDS)

**Intent**  
Measure how system functionality degrades as stress intensity increases.

**Procedure**

1. Execute workload **W** at ordered stress intensity levels *s₁ … sₙ*
2. Measure task completion rate **Cᵢ ∈ [0,1]** at each level

Stress levels **MUST** be ordered monotonically by declared intensity.

**Definition**

```

GDS = (1 / n) × Σ Cᵢ

```

**Interpretation**  
GDS captures average functional retention, not degradation shape. Systems exhibiting abrupt collapse and gradual degradation may receive identical GDS values.

---

### 4.2 BP-2: Autonomous Recovery Rate (ARR)

**Intent**  
Measure the system’s ability to recover from faults without external intervention.

**Procedure**

1. Inject faults classified as recoverable under baseline conditions
2. Measure:
   - **Fᵣ** = number of recoverable faults injected
   - **Fₐ** = number of faults resolved autonomously

**Definition**

```

ARR = Fₐ / Fᵣ

```

---

### 4.3 BP-3: Isolation Survival Time (IST)

**Intent**  
Measure endurance under complete isolation.

**Procedure**

1. Enforce SR-5 complete isolation
2. Measure time to irreversible failure **T_f**

**Normalization**

```

IST = min(T_f / T_max, 1.0)

```

**Constraint**  
**T_max MUST be identical** across systems when IST values are compared.

---

### 4.4 BP-4: Resource Efficiency Under Constraint (REC)

**Intent**  
Measure useful work per unit resource under constraint relative to baseline operation.

**Procedure**

1. Measure baseline efficiency **E_base**
2. Measure constrained efficiency **E_stress**

**Definition**

```

REC = min(E_stress / E_base, 1.0)

```

**Validity Constraint**  
REC is valid only if baseline task completion exceeds a declared minimum threshold.

---

### 4.5 BP-5: Cascading Failure Resistance (CFR)

**Intent**  
Measure containment of localized failures.

**Procedure**

1. Inject a localized fault
2. Measure:
   - **C_local** = number of affected components
   - **C_total** = total number of components

**Definition**

```

CFR = 1 − (C_local / C_total)

```

**Component Definition Constraint**  
Components **MUST** be defined at a consistent abstraction level across all tests.

---

## 5. Orbital Reliability Index (ORI)

### 5.1 Aggregation Formula

Let weights **wⱼ** satisfy:

```

Σ wⱼ = 1

```

Canonical OCRB v0 weighting uses equal weights:

```

ORI = (1 / 5) × Σ BPⱼ

```

Alternate weightings **MAY** be used for exploratory analysis but **MUST NOT** be presented as canonical OCRB scores.

---

### 5.2 Statistical Reporting Requirements

- Minimum of **10 independent test runs**
- Report:
  - Mean ORI
  - Standard deviation
  - 95% confidence interval

The statistical method used **MUST** be documented.

---

## 6. Reproducibility Requirements

An OCRB-compliant result **MUST** include:

- Full stress regime definition
- Workload specification
- Random seeds used
- Hardware and runtime environment summary
- Software versions and dependencies

---

## 7. Interpretation Constraints

OCRB scores **MUST NOT** be used to:

- Predict real-world system failure rates
- Certify systems for deployment
- Compare across stress regimes
- Compare across workload classes

ORI values are comparative indicators **only within declared constraints**.

---

## 8. Versioning and Extension Rules

- OCRB v0 Behavioral Proxy definitions are immutable
- New stress parameters require a major version increment
- New reference stress regimes MAY be added in minor versions
- Weighting changes **MUST NOT** alter v0 canonical scores

---

## 9. Relationship to Implementation

This specification defines **what must be measured**.  
Implementations define **how measurements are realized**.

Any implementation deviating from this specification **MUST** document deviations explicitly.

---

## 10. Summary

OCRB v0 provides a behaviorally grounded, statistically reproducible framework for evaluating computational resilience when foundational assumptions no longer hold.

This specification, together with the Technical Brief, defines the complete OCRB v0 standard.
