## 1. Purpose and Normative Status

This document defines **normative reference stress profiles** for OCRB v0.

A stress profile is a concrete instantiation of the OCRB stress parameters (SR-1 through SR-5) used during benchmark execution.

OCRB results are **invalid** unless stress profiles are explicitly declared and conform to this specification.

This document is **normative** for OCRB v0 stress profile definition and application.

---

## 2. Stress Profile Design Principles

All OCRB stress profiles **MUST** satisfy the following:

1. **Parameter Explicitness**  
   All stress parameters MUST be explicitly defined.

2. **Reproducibility**  
   Stochastic stress MUST use seeded pseudorandom processes.

3. **Independence from Physical Fidelity**  
   Stress profiles represent computational pressure, not physical simulation.

4. **Comparability**  
   Stress profiles MUST be reusable across systems and implementations.

---

## 3. Stress Profile Declaration Requirements

Each OCRB execution **MUST** declare a stress profile containing:

- Stress Profile ID  
- Values for SR-1 through SR-5  
- Random seed(s) used  
- Stress duration  
- Application schedule (continuous, periodic, or stochastic)

Stress duration is implementation-defined but **MUST** be held constant for valid comparisons.

Profiles **MUST** be immutable once versioned.

## 4. Stress Parameter Definitions (Normative)

### SR-1: Radiation Pressure

**Intent:** Introduce probabilistic transient computation faults.

**Definition:**  
- Bit-flip probability per memory unit per unit time  
- Optional processor-level transient error injection

**Constraints:**  
- Fault injection MUST be non-correlated unless explicitly declared  
- Faults MUST be recoverable unless otherwise specified  

---

### SR-2: Thermal Cycling

**Intent:** Model periodic environmental stress affecting error likelihood.

**Definition:**  
- Cycle period  
- Stress amplitude (multiplicative factor on fault probability)

**Constraints:**  
- Thermal stress MUST NOT directly halt execution  
- Effects MUST be indirect (e.g., increased fault probability)  

---

### SR-3: Power Disruption

**Intent:** Model intermittent or degraded power availability.

**Definition:**  
- Availability percentage  
- Interruption duration  
- Interruption schedule (periodic or stochastic)

**Constraints:**  
- Interruptions MUST be externally imposed  
- Power loss MAY pause or terminate execution as defined by the workload  

---

### SR-4: Network Jitter

**Intent:** Degrade communication reliability.

**Definition:**  
- Baseline latency  
- Latency variance  
- Packet loss or disconnection probability

**Constraints:**  
- Network disruption MUST NOT corrupt payload data  
- Effects are limited to delay, loss, or unavailability  

---

### SR-5: Isolation Duration

**Intent:** Enforce complete isolation from external coordination.

**Definition:**  
- Maximum isolation duration  
- Trigger condition (time-based or event-based)

**Constraints:**  
- Isolation implies zero external communication  
- Internal system communication MAY continue unless otherwise specified  

---

## 5. Canonical OCRB v0 Stress Profiles

OCRB v0 defines the following canonical stress profiles.

### 5.1 SP-0: Baseline (Control)

**Purpose:** Establish unstressed baseline behavior.

| Parameter | Value |
|---------|------|
| SR-1 | Disabled |
| SR-2 | Disabled |
| SR-3 | 100% availability |
| SR-4 | Minimal latency, no jitter |
| SR-5 | Disabled |

---

### 5.2 SP-1: Moderate Constraint

**Purpose:** Evaluate resilience under realistic but non-extreme stress.

| Parameter | Value |
|---------|------|
| SR-1 | Low fault injection rate |
| SR-2 | Moderate periodic cycling |
| SR-3 | ~90% availability, short interruptions |
| SR-4 | Moderate latency with jitter |
| SR-5 | Short isolation periods |

---

### 5.3 SP-2: Severe Constraint

**Purpose:** Expose failure modes under sustained stress.

| Parameter | Value |
|---------|------|
| SR-1 | Elevated fault injection rate |
| SR-2 | High-amplitude cycling |
| SR-3 | ~70% availability, extended interruptions |
| SR-4 | High latency, frequent disconnections |
| SR-5 | Extended isolation duration |

---

## 6. Stress Profile Application Rules

- Stress profiles MUST be applied consistently across all runs  
- Parameter changes invalidate comparisons  
- Stress profiles MUST be disclosed alongside ORI results  
- Combining profiles is NOT permitted in OCRB v0  

---

## 7. Extension Rules

- New stress parameters require a major version increment  
- New stress profiles MAY be added in minor versions  
- Canonical profiles are immutable once versioned  

---

## 8. Interpretation Constraints

- OCRB scores MUST NOT be compared across different stress profiles  
- Stress profiles MUST NOT be interpreted as real environmental conditions  
- Stress profiles are comparative tools only  

---

## 9. Summary

Reference stress profiles define how pressure is applied within OCRB.

They ensure resilience measurements are reproducible, interpretable, and comparable without relying on physical simulation or proprietary data.
