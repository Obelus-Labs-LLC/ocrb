## 1. Purpose

The Orbital Compute Readiness Benchmark (OCRB) is a reliability benchmarking framework designed to evaluate how computational workloads behave when foundational operating assumptions are violated by environmental and systemic constraints.

Unlike terrestrial benchmarks—which typically assume continuous power, stable connectivity, and rare environmental disruption—OCRB focuses on resilience and behavioral stability under persistent stress, rather than performance optimization, throughput, or cost efficiency.

OCRB provides a reproducible, comparative methodology for observing how systems fail, degrade, contain errors, and recover when exposed to structured environmental pressure. The framework produces a composite metric, the **Orbital Reliability Index (ORI)**, representing a system’s demonstrated behavioral stability under a defined stress regime.

## 2. Scope and Technical Boundaries

### 2.1 What OCRB Evaluates

- Comparative resilience, not absolute correctness  
- Behavior under constraint, not optimal performance  
- Failure modes and recovery behavior, not mission success  

OCRB is intended for pre-deployment evaluation and research, enabling consistent comparison across architectures, workloads, and system designs operating under non-ideal conditions.

### 2.2 Explicit Non-Goals

OCRB v0 explicitly does not:

- Predict real-world orbital failures or mission outcomes  
- Replace flight testing, hardware qualification, or certification processes  
- Model high-fidelity orbital mechanics or physical environments  
- Require proprietary telemetry, classified data, or custom hardware  
- Provide operational monitoring or control capabilities  
- Optimize workload performance, scheduling, or cost  

These exclusions are intentional and preserve interpretability, reproducibility, and technical credibility.

### 2.3 Design Philosophy

OCRB prioritizes:

**Interpretability and reproducibility over fidelity or exhaustiveness.**

Environmental effects are treated as structured stress abstractions, not precise physical simulations. The framework is designed to measure behavioral response, not physical accuracy.

---

## 3. Environmental Stress Model (v0)

OCRB models environmental pressure through **Stress Regimes**—parameterized sets of constraints that computational systems must tolerate.

Stress regimes describe forces acting on computation, rather than exact physical replication of any specific environment. A stress regime is defined independently of deployment location and may represent orbital, terrestrial-hostile, or other constrained operating conditions.

## 3.1 Core Stress Parameters

OCRB v0 defines five fundamental stress parameters:

| Parameter | Definition | Modeling Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **SR-1: Radiation Pressure** | Probability of memory corruption and transient computational errors | Probabilistic bit-flip injection |
| **SR-2: Thermal Cycling** | Periodic stress from environmental heating and cooling | Time-based periodic stress function |
| **SR-3: Power Disruption** | Intermittent or degraded energy availability | Scheduled or stochastic execution interruptions |
| **SR-4: Network Jitter** | Unreliable communication and coordination | Bounded latency variability and intermittent connectivity loss |
| **SR-5: Isolation Duration** | Maximum time operating without external coordination | Forced complete isolation periods with no external data |

These parameters are intentionally abstracted to enable repeatability and comparative evaluation.

---

## 3.2 Example Stress Regime (Illustrative Only)

**Example Stress Regime: LEO-Nominal (Illustrative)**

- **SR-1 (Radiation):** Low-to-moderate fault injection rate  
- **SR-2 (Thermal):** 90-minute cycle, moderate stress amplitude  
- **SR-3 (Power):** Periodic interruptions, ~85% availability  
- **SR-4 (Network):** Moderate baseline latency with high jitter and intermittent loss  
- **SR-5 (Isolation):** Up to 90 minutes of complete isolation  

This example is illustrative only and does not represent validated orbital conditions.

## 4. Behavioral Proxies (Evaluation Metrics)

OCRB defines readiness behaviorally, using observable system responses rather than internal implementation details. Five **Behavioral Proxies (BP)** are evaluated:

- **BP-1: Graceful Degradation Score (GDS)**  
  Proportion of core functionality maintained as stress intensity increases.

- **BP-2: Autonomous Recovery Rate (ARR)**  
  Percentage of recoverable failures that resolve without external intervention.

- **BP-3: Isolation Survival Time (IST)**  
  Mean time to irreversible failure when operating in complete isolation.

- **BP-4: Resource Efficiency Under Constraint (REC)**  
  Ratio of useful work completed to resources consumed under constraint, relative to baseline operation.

- **BP-5: Cascading Failure Resistance (CFR)**  
  Degree to which localized failures remain contained versus propagating to other components.

These proxies serve as infrastructure-level indicators of resilience and do not imply intelligence, autonomy, or correctness.

---

## 5. Orbital Reliability Index (ORI)

The **Orbital Reliability Index (ORI)** is a composite, normalized score derived from the weighted aggregation of behavioral proxies.

ORI is normalized to the interval **[0, 1]** for OCRB v0.

ORI values are meaningful only within the specific stress regime under which they are measured and are not intended to generalize across environments.

### 5.1 Score Classification (Descriptive)

- **≥ 0.85** — Demonstrates consistently bounded degradation across tested parameters  
- **0.70 – 0.84** — Maintains functional stability under most stress conditions  
- **0.50 – 0.69** — Remains functional but exhibits significant degradation  
- **< 0.50** — Exhibits low behavioral stability under the tested stress regime  

These classifications are descriptive and non-prescriptive.

### 5.2 Comparison Validity Rules

Valid comparisons require:

- Identical stress regime parameters  
- Equivalent workload definitions  
- A minimum of 10 independent test runs  
- Reported confidence intervals with documented interpretation  

Invalid comparisons include:

- Comparing ORI across different stress regimes  
- Comparing different workload classes  
- Using ORI to predict real-world failure rates  
- Interpreting small ORI differences without considering confidence intervals  

---

## 6. Minimum Implementation Requirements

A minimum viable OCRB v0 implementation must provide:

- **Stress Injector** — programmable fault, delay, and interruption injection  
- **Measurement Harness** — instrumentation capturing behavioral proxies  
- **ORI Calculator** — weighted aggregation with statistical analysis  
- **Transparency** — inspectable methodology and reproducible results  

An implementation is considered successful when independent users can reproduce ORI results within a documented tolerance defined by the reference implementation or complete specification.

---

## 7. Summary

OCRB v0 defines a structured, reproducible approach to evaluating computational resilience when foundational assumptions no longer hold.

It does not predict outcomes, certify systems, or simulate physics.  
It provides a common ruler for comparing how systems behave under constraint.
