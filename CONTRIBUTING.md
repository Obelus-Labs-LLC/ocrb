# Contributing to OCRB

OCRB is a technical standard maintained by Obelus Labs LLC. Contributions are welcome, but v0 core definitions are intentionally strict.

## What We Accept
- Bug reports and inconsistencies in existing specifications
- Clarifications that improve interpretability without changing meaning
- Reference implementation improvements (once code exists)
- Additional workloads or profiles (subject to versioning rules)

## What We Don’t Accept
- Changes to OCRB v0 Behavioral Proxy definitions
- New stress parameters (requires a major version increment)
- Modifications that reduce reproducibility or comparability
- “Optimization guidance” that turns the benchmark into a tuning target

## Process
1. Open an issue describing the change and rationale
2. Maintainers review for scope, compatibility, and versioning impact
3. If accepted, submit a pull request
4. Maintainer decision and merge

## Governance
Final decisions rest with maintainers under Obelus Labs LLC.
