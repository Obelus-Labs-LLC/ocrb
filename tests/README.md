# OCRB Compliance Tests

This directory will contain tests used to validate
OCRB implementations for correctness, reproducibility,
and specification adherence.

## Intended Contents
- Determinism and seed reproducibility checks
- Metric calculation validation
- Statistical reporting verification
- Regression tests for reference implementation behavior

## Scope
These tests validate compliance with OCRB specifications.
They are not performance benchmarks and do not test
application-level correctness beyond defined OCRB metrics.
